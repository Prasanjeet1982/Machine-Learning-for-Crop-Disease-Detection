# Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a crop disease detection system using machine learning techniques. It includes a training program for building the detection model and a FastAPI application for making predictions based on the trained model.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

1. Prepare your training and validation datasets by placing them in appropriate directories.
2. Edit the paths and hyperparameters in the `train.py` file.
3. Run the training program:

```bash
python train.py
```

The trained model will be saved as `model_checkpoint.h5`.

### Running the FastAPI Application

1. Edit the paths and model path in the `app.py` and `prediction.py` files.
2. Start the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the Swagger documentation and test the API.
